#### What is dymanic form?

reuse the certain form with the same logic and change the form based on your configuration.

Reuse the logic and style

our form has been generated by the configuration file

it will be easy to modify and layout

and avoid code duplication

#### Why sub-form?

First of all, we could duplicate the address sub-form Typescript definition and HTML template for every parent form which needs to use it. This will work and it will be also easy to understand.

As we will be adding address form to more and more parent forms, once we need to make a change it will get pretty time consuming. Let‚Äôs imagine that the backend service renamed the house `number` property to `houseNumber`. We would have to find all the occurrences in every form definition and corresponding template and make the adjustments„ÄÇ

**Sometimes, duplication is the correct answer**. On the other hand, it might be possible to expect that the entity like `Address` could diverge based on particular use case as the application evolves.

**Dedicated sub-form component**. The first thing we could do is to extract sub-form template into dedicated component and then pass parent `FormGroup` through the sub-form components `@Input()` to bind it in its template‚Ä¶Our solution works but unfortunately is **fragile**. We have reduced template code duplication but the sub-form information is now located in two different places‚Ä¶

#### ==What is RXJS?==

RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. ... RxJS provides an implementation of the Observable type, which is needed unwtil the type becomes part of the language and until browsers support it.

#### Did you use any filters(AngularJS) in you project?

In my previous project, we basicly use Angular 2+, filter is the attribute of AngularJS. In my project, we use pipe in the template to manipulate data step by step or get the data from observables. We have many build-in pipes in Angular, like **DatePipe, LowerCasePipe, UpperCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, Decimal Pipe** and so on. We can also create custom pipes. We can also use the pipe function from Rxjs to manipulate data in observable. 

To use pipe in the template, we should use a pipe symbol (|) followed by the proper pipe name based on your choice.

If we want data transformation based on our custom requirement, then we need to create our own pipe to fulfill our requirement. The custom pipe is a function which takes the value and other arguments in order to process the data and return the transformed value.

custom pipe --> **transform(value:any args?:any):any**

And there is a method called `transform()`, which accepts the real value that needs to be transformed along with other arguments.

**Custom pipe to format the telephone number.**

#### What is SPAs?

Single page applications are lightning-fast, easy to deploy and provide the butter-smooth user experience. SPAs achieve this by **dynamically updating website content without reloading the whole page**. Just like in a desktop or native app.

#### What is the difference between Cookies and LoacalStorage?

##### Introduction to Cookies

 In fact, cookies are **small files** which are located on a user‚Äôs computer. They are designed to hold a generous amount of data specific to a client and website, and they can **accessed either by the web server or the client computer**. The reason behind this is to allow the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which knows of the data in the cookie, and therefore it is able to carry information from one visit to the website to the next.

Each cookie is effectively a small lookup table containing pairs of key, data values. Once the cookie has been read by the code on the server or the client computer, the data can be retrieved and used to customize the web.

Cookies are pretty much a convenient way to **carry information from one session on a website to another**, or between sessions on related websites, without having to burden a server machine with massive amounts of data storage. If we were to store data on the server without using cookies, then it would be difficult to retrieve a particular user‚Äôs information without requiring a login on each visit to the website. Therefore, a cookie can simply be used if there is a large amount of information to store. In addition a cookie can be made to persist for an arbitrary length of time.

##### Introduction to localStorage

localStorage is a way to **store data on the client‚Äôs computer**. It allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration date. localStorage can only be accessed via JavaScript, and HTML5. However, the user has the ability to clear the browser data/cache to erase all localStorage data. Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much **greater storage capacity**.  The available size is 5MB, which is more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie. In addition with localStorage, **the data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request** (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc.), which thus reduces the amount of traffic between client and server. Lastly, it works on same-origin policy, so the data stored will only be available on the same origin.

##### Differences between cookies and localStorage

Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. Cookies are mainly for ==reading server-side==, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side. Apart from saving data, a big technical difference is ==the size of data you can store==, and as I mentioned earlier localStorage gives you more to work with. In conclusion, the question when dealing with the two, one should ask is, in your application who needs this data the client or the server?



# what is the differience between Angular and JQuery

Angular is a framwork

Jquey

#### üçìWhat is the difference between get and put in HTTPClient?

##### HTTP Messages

HTTP messages are how data is exchanged between a server and a client. There are two types of messages: *requests* sent by the client to trigger an action on the server, and *responses*, the answer from the server.

HTTP requests, and responses, share similar structure and are composed of:

1. A *start-line* describing the requests to be implemented, or its status of whether successful or a failure. This start-line is always a single line.
2. An optional set of *HTTP headers* specifying the request, or describing the body included in the message.
3. A blank line indicating all meta-information for the request has been sent.
4. An optional *body* containing data associated with the request (like content of an HTML form), or the document associated with a response. The presence of the body and its size is specified by the start-line and HTTP headers.

##### What is GET?

GET method is used to appends form data to the URL in name or value pair. If you use GET, the length of URL will remain limited.

The `HttpClient.get` sends the HTTP Get Request to the API and parses the returned result to the desired type. By default, the body of the response is parsed as JSON. If you want any other type, then you need to specify explicitly using the `observe` & `responseType` options.

```typescript
get(url: string, 
      options: {
          headers?: HttpHeaders | { [header: string]: string | string[]; };
          params?: HttpParams | { [param: string]: string | string[]; };
          observe?: "body|events|response|";
          responseType: "arraybuffer|json|blob|text";
          reportProgress?: boolean; 
          withCredentials?: boolean;}
     ): Observable<>
```





#### How to write a leaner code?

1. ##### Decide on the indentation and keep it that way

   The code should be divided into logical units and it‚Äôs important to keep the style consistent throughout the whole document. In most of the programming languages, spaces and indentations do not affect the function. If you are using an IDE, it is recommended that you create a formatted config so everyone uses the same one.

2. ##### Make comments

   Comments will help you and others understand why you did what you did. It may seem obvious to you when you are writing it, but will others who work on the code understand it? Will you remember what you did after a month or a year? Comments are worthwhile as long as they are a few and written for key passages. Too many comments at every single line will make the code completely unreadable and messy.

3. ##### Consistent name scheme

   Usually, Languages have their own naming conventions. For example, java uses camelCase. Naming needs to stay consistent, otherwise, it will very difficult to find things inside the document.

   There are two main ways to name things:

   - - camelCase: which means that every word of the file name is capitalized except for the first one, e.g. nameFilesConsistently
     - Underscores: in this case you write underscores between each word, e.g. name_files_consistently

4. ##### Don‚Äôt repeat code

   Repeating code will make your document very long and it will break the reading flow. If you have pieces of code that will be used more then ones, it is preferable to make a separate file or a function and include the file path when needed. A typical example is a web page: most pages will have the same header and footer, but there is no need to copy-paste the same code onto every page, just link to it.

5. ##### Avoid writing long code lines

   Writing long lines of code makes it very difficult to read, moving back and forth horizontally, losing any sense of what it‚Äôs actually written. Keep also in mind, that the terminal window limits characters to 80 per line, so if the code is longer, it will be just cut, making it incomprehensible.

6. ##### Break down a big task into smaller chunks

   A whole new feature will never be just a few lines long. Even with comments, a 500-lines function will still be a pain to browse, understand and edit. Your best choice is to break down the big task into a smaller chunk of code. In Angular, we can break a functionality into a bunch of components and make these components as a feature module.

7. ##### Organize your program into smaller files

   Having a file with thousands of lines of code doesn‚Äôt help anyone, but broken down into shorter files organized based on function or feature will help you get right to the point when something needs fixing. Having the whole code organized in files and folders is very good for maintainability, especially if different teams and people are working on it. 

8. ##### Write clever code that is also readable

   Write clever code, but the main focus should be on readability and maintainability.

   If the code is kept short it is easier to go through, but if it‚Äôs too smart, it will take too much time to understand and edit it. You know that your code was too clever if you can‚Äôt read it after 3 months. So be clever but not too much.

9. ##### Code refactoring

   You write some code because you want to finish the feature and in the end, it works. When you then look at it after some time you think ‚Äì did I really write that? I could have shortened it so much! So you start rewriting that piece of code better, probably shorter, without changing any functionality.

10. ##### Delete unnecessary code

11. ##### Use Design Patterns

    A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design).



#### What is the difference between Observable and Subject?

Observable help us to manage async data. You can think of Observables as an array of items, which arrive asynchronously over time. The `observables` implement the [observer design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern), where `observables`maintain a list of dependents. We call these dependents as `observers`. The `observable` notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.

`Observer` subscribes to an `Observable`. The `observer` reacts when the value of the `Observable` changes. An `Observable` can have multiple subscribers and all the subscribers are notified when the state of the `Observable` changes.

In stream programming there are two main interfaces: **Observable** and **Observer**. **Observable** is for the consumer, it can be transformed and subscribed:

```JS
observable.map(x => ...).filter(x => ...).subscribe(x => ...)
```

**Observer** is the interface which is used to feed an observable source:

```js
observer.next(newItem)
```

We can create new **Observable** with an **Observer**

Or, we can use a **Subject** which implements both the **Observable** and the **Observer** interfaces

==Observables== are **unicast** by design and Subjects are multicast by design. An RxJS Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to many Observers. While plain Observables are unicast (**each subscribed Observer owns an independent execution of the Observable**), Subjects are multicast.

Unicast means can emit values from the observable not from any other component.

Multicast means can cast values to multiple subscribers and can act as both subscribers and emmitter



Observable: Observable creates copy of data for each observer. 

Subject: Same data get shared between all observers.



#### ==Observable vs Promise==

**Promise**

A `Promise` handles a **single event** when an async operation completes or fails.

**Observable**

An `Observable` is like a **`Stream`** (in many languages) and allows to pass zero or more events where the callback is called for each event.

Often `Observable` is preferred over `Promise` because it provides the features of `Promise` and more. With `Observable` it doesn't matter if you want to handle 0, 1, or multiple events. You can utilize the same API in each case.

`Observable` also has the advantage over `Promise` to be **cancellable**. If the result of an HTTP request to a server or some other expensive async operation isn't needed anymore, the `Subscription` of an `Observable` allows to cancel the subscription, while a `Promise` will eventually call the success or failed callback even when you don't need the notification or the result it provides anymore.

While a `Promise` starts immediately, an `Observable` only starts if you subscribe to it. This is why Observables are called lazy.

Observable provides **operators** like `map`, `forEach`, `reduce`, ... similar to an array

Both `Promises` and `Observables` provide us with abstractions that help us deal with the **asynchronous** nature of our applications.

#### What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?

One vital distinction between [Angular](https://angular.io/) vs [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)[ ](https://www.ebuilderz.com/angular-vs-angularjs/)is AngularJS is ==[JavaScript](https://stackify.com/a-practical-guide-to-javascript-debugging/)-based== while Angular is ==TypeScript based==. These two frameworks have similarities as a front end, open-source platform that create dynamic SPAs. 

##### **Components of Angular vs AngularJS**

The TypeScript that Angular uses is a superset of ES6, which has backward compatibility with ES5. Angular JS, based on JavaScript, uses terms of **scope and controllers** while Angular uses a **hierarchy of components**. **Angular is component-based while AngularJS uses directives**.



##### **Use of Directives between Angular vs AngularJS**

While both Angular and AngularJS use Directives, how they use them makes the difference. Angular has standard Directives while AngularJS has a pack of them. One has to be cautious while using the Directives. For instance, when you want to create a two-way binding in AngularJS, you will have to use the ng-model. For one-way binding, you will use ng-bind.

In Angular, you will find only the ngModel. You can use the symbols for one-way binding as:‚Äù [],‚Äù and two-way binding as:‚Äù [()].‚Äù ‚Äú[]‚Äù is for property binding, while ‚Äú()‚Äù is for event binding.



##### **Architecture of Angular vs AngularJS**

##### **Angular JS**(MVC)

This framework has a ==model-view-controller (MVC)== that acts as the central component as it manages data, logic, rules, and expresses how the applications behave.

**Model**: The model is where all data is stored.

**View:** The view generates the output after reviewing the information in the model.

**Controller:** The controller receives the input and converts it to commands which it sends to the model and view.

##### **Angular**(component-based)

Angular uses components that are directives with templates. There are two kinds of directives in Angular.

**Structural directives**: they alter the DOM‚Äôs layout by replacing its elements.

**Attributive directives**: it changes how the DOM behave and the appearance of the element.



##### **Mobile support** 

AngularJS does not provide mobile support while Angular supports mobile.



##### **Performance and Speed** 

**Angular JS;** The two-way binding feature ultimately reduces the efforts and time of construction.

**Angular;** The framework upgraded to a better structure, which provides improved performance and speed.



##### **Tool support** 

**Angular JS;** The framework relies on third-party tools such as IDE and WebStorm.

**Angular:** It uses the Command Line Interface (CLI) to reduce the time when creating applications.



##### **The advantages of Angular vs AngularJS**

##### **Angular**

##### **Modularity:** 

Most of Angular‚Äôs core functionality moved to various modules that created a lighter and a faster core.

##### **Dynamic loading:**

There is a combination of asynchronous templates and added support for reactive programming.

##### **AOT/**Ahead-of-Time:

This compilation helps convert the HTML and TypeScript into JavaScript during the **build time process**. AOT compiles the code and the browser loads the compiled code for faster rendering.

##### **CLI:**

Command Line Interface helps to create and serve angular applications. It takes care of project building and makes testing more accessible.

##### **The architectural component:**

This helps to **divide the functional and logical components**.

##### **Dependency Injection:**

Angular uses unidirectional change detection. Rather than using directives like AngularJS use, Angular makes use of Hierarchical Dependency Injection to boost the framework‚Äôs performance significantly.

##### **Language**:

Although Angular is written in TypeScript, it also has other language choices such as ES5, ES6, and Dart, used for writing codes.

##### **Routing:**

The Angular framework has a simple path. It can interpret a URL as a directive to navigate to a client-view.



##### **Advantages of AngularJS vs Angular**

- **MVC:** The Model View Controller uses data binding to speed up application development.

- The use of two-way data binding and POJO Models provides a conclusive interface that enables you to use less code in your projects.

- AngularJS comes with a ready unit testing feature that is continuously updated. A developer uses his own code to find any defects in his design.

- AngularJS offers a comprehensive solution for frontend development since it does not depend on other frameworks and plugins.

- Since the declarative language AngularJS uses is HTML, it is quite intuitive.

- The AngularJS framework provides the user with reusable-components.

- AngularJS has a much simpler architecture to develop mobile and web applications quickly. 



**D**espite the differences between Angular vs Angular JS, they each have their benefits. Google maintains both frameworks, and so they both have extensive community support. I prefer Angular because it creates dynamic applications for both web and mobiles and can create single-page applications using TypeScript and HTML.



#### What is the difference between React and Angular?

So how do Angular, a framework, and React, a library, compare with each other?

Let‚Äôs break down the terms *framework* and *library* first.

##### **What Is a Framework?**

A software framework (be it front-end or backend) includes standardized, pre-written code, which makes the development of certain functionalities easier and faster. You have less freedom to code, as you have to code as the framework architecture dictates.

##### **What Is a Library?**

A library is a collection of functions and functionalities, which you can use to achieve a certain end. You have more freedom to design and construct the system when using a library, but that adds more responsibility on the coder to be able to use it efficiently and find the right library for the right job, because, for projects which need to grow over time and become more serious, this could become significantly riskier and more difficult to manage.



The most significant difference between a framework and a library is how they interact with your code.

*Your code calls the library while the framework calls your code.* 

*This is also known as Inversion of Control. The litmus test for detecting a framework is checking if it has the Inversion of Control.*



##### **Angular**

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a TypeScript-based, open-source front-end web application platform. It is an MVC framework created by Google. MVC is an architecture type for frameworks that develop user interfaces. It translates to **M**odel **V**iew **C**ontroller.

Angular is a giant when it comes to creating dynamic web apps. In its release of Angular 5, Google added support for progressive web apps as well.



##### **React**

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook, Instagram, and the community, React is evolving at an impressively increasing rate. Outside of the pure React library itself, there are 3 distinct versions of React: React-devtools, ReactJS.Net, React Native. Other than React itself, React Native is pretty popular as well for creating Native mobile apps. If you are interested, you can check out the [pros and cons of React Native](https://citrusbits.com/react-native-pros-and-cons/).

React does fall a little short, being a JS library, but, when combined with other libraries, you get a powerful solution to any problem. This is also why React has earned its place as one of the main competitors of Angular



#### The Major Differences Between React and Angular

##### **Data Binding**

Angular allows two-way data binding while React allows one-way data binding.

Two-way data binding means that any changes you make to the model affect the view, and vice versa.

One-way data binding means any changes you make to the model affect the view, but not the other way around. This way, the data only flows in one direction.

These are also called Bidirectional and Unidirectional data flows, respectively.

##### **DOM Usage**

DOM is the Data Object Model of a web app. You can either use a regular DOM or create a virtual DOM.

**Angular** uses the browser's DOM, while **React** uses a virtual DOM.

A virtual DOM is a simplified version of the DOM. By using a virtual DOM, you can change any element very quickly and without needing to render the whole DOM. It drastically changes the performance from good to excellent.

Imagine the difference in performance in needing to render all 100 items when just a single item is changed, then just rendering a single changed item and not rendering the rest.

Using the virtual DOM is quite the buzz nowadays because it is faster, and speed is key!

##### **Language**

Angularis a JS framework by nature, but is built to use TypeScript. **React,** on the other hand, is a JavaScript library as well, but recommends using JSX.

The difference lies here: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript while JSX is Javascript but with extended XML syntax.

If you want the best of Angular or React, you must learn to use TypeScript or JSX, which brings me to my next point.

*The creators of JSX claim it's faster, safer, and easier than JS*

##### **Learning Curve**

This will differ from individual to individual based on skill and experience. On average, TypeScript is considered harder to learn than JSX, in turn increasing the learning curve with Angular as compared to React.

If you already are familiar with JavaScript, then learning to work with React will not be much of a hurdle, but learning Angular, even with some familiarity with JavaScript, will still be a bit of a strain.

##### **Native Application Development Support**

As I mentioned earlier, React has a sibling by the name of React Native, which allows you to build a complete mobile app for either Android or iOS. Not a web app that runs on a mobile phone, but a full-fledged mobile app built with JavaScript.

Sure, with Angular you can build hybrid mobile apps, but let's be fair, a native mobile app will always outdo a hybrid mobile app.

Not only do the React Native apps show increased performance, but they feel and work very similarly to the respective native mobile platforms.

##### **App Structure**

Angular is a fully-featured MVC framework. React is just more of a 'V' in the MVC.

Angular's MVC structure allows applications to be divided into three interconnected components, thus they are easier to manipulate, once learned.

MVC architectures produce well-structured code which is immensely beneficial for complex projects.

However, React does not enforce an app structure by itself, it depends on the developer. This, for some, could be great or could be their Achilles heel.

There are other differences as well, but I think these are the very basic differences in React and Angular.

**Now that you know the major differences in Angular and React, let‚Äôs find out what to use and when.**

**React** is pretty much ideal for logicless applications or computation-less apps. In cases where you need a custom solution, React will best suit your needs because, with React, you can build almost anything.

Especially if you are building:

- **Dynamic Applications:** React will be a great choice because it uses a virtual DOM. It can quickly incorporate and "react" to the data changes made in the view by the users.
- **Single Page Apps:** React will be a great solution because it can display all changes made to the content without reloading the current page.
- **Native Mobile Apps:** If you wish to create a native mobile app, there is nothing better than React Native. You will be creating apps written in JavaScript with equal performance and feel of apps created in Java or Objective-C. **Angular** is ideal if you have a large application and you need strict code structure and base.

**Angular** is best for creating:

- **Cross-platform Mobile Apps:** Angular 2+ has great support for mobile apps, as it was created for that very purpose. It addresses limiting factors such as navigation via touch, different screen sizes, and mobile hardware.
- **Enterprise Software:** Because Angular uses an MVC architecture, it is great for creating enterprise level apps.
- **Progressive Web Apps and Hybrid Mobile Apps:** Angular 2, in combination with Ionic 2, is a perfect tool for building hybrid apps. The same technology stack can be used for progressive web app development. Angular 2 (and up) comes with a mobile toolkit which makes developing mobile apps extremely easy and quick.



#### What is TypeScript? The benefit about TS, why typescript.

1. Class and Module Support

   Keywords like class, interface, extends and module are available in TypeScript. 

2. Static Type-checking

   TypeScript compiler will check the type (to surface more typing errors at compiling time), A practical example is if we use the wrong data type in the browser beacon, we now get compiling errors. Before migrating to Typescript, they could only be found by testing against the back-end.

3. ES6 Feature Support

   With TypeScript, you can start using many ES6 features although it may not be supported in your target browser. TypeScript compile can compile the ts files into ‚ÄúES3‚Äù, ‚ÄúES5‚Äù or ‚ÄúES6‚Äù.

4. Clear Library API Definition

   To let other TypeScript libraries use your library, you need to create a .d.ts file to declare all your public types and APIs of your library.
   These definition files turned out to be clear and accurate references of your public APIs since they are always maintained and update-to-date because you always need them if you write your tests in TypeScript too.

5. Build-in Support for JavaScript Packaging

   You can define one main entry ts file and refer all the ts files you need in the output js file.

   Compiling the main entry ts file with the ‚Äìout option, the compiler will concatenate all the directly or indirectly referred ts files into one js file in the order they are referred. Thus, we can easily tailor our library into multiple versions.
   For example, with the same code base, we are able to generate specific versions of browser agents for desktop and mobile respectively. We just need to create one entry file for each version with different ts files referred in it.

6. Syntax Similarity to Our Backend Languages (Java, [Scala](http://www.slideshare.net/razvanc/quick-typescript-vs-scala-sample))

   TypeScript‚Äôs similarity to these languages allows our developers can switch between front-end and back-end programming more smoothly.

   

#### What are the differences between Component and Directive?

Directives

Angular templates are *dynamic*. When Angular renders them, it transforms the DOM according to the instructions given by *directives*. A directive is a class with a @Directive() decorator.

In addition to components, there are two other kinds of directives: *structural* and *attribute*. Angular defines a number of directives of both kinds, and you can define your own using the @Directive() decorator.

Just as for components, the metadata for a directive associates the decorated class with a selector element that you use to insert it into HTML. In templates, directives typically appear within an element tag as attributes, either by name or as the target of an assignment or a binding.



Components

Components are basically just a new type of directive that is designed for component-based architecture. In a lot of ways, components are more restricted in their functionality, instead encouraging better conventions and design that actually leads to more maintainable and reusable code.

Components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that Angular defines the @Component() decorator, which extends the @Directive() decorator with template-oriented features.       

 **‚ÄúComponent is a directive with a view or template‚Äù**  

#### What is a data binding? 

Data binding is the process that establishes a connection between the app UI and the data it displays. If the binding has the correct settings and the data provides the proper notifications, when the data changes its value, the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes automatically. Data binding can also mean that if an outer representation of the data in an element changes, then the underlying data can be automatically updated to reflect the change. For example, if the user edits the value in a `TextBox`, the underlying data value is automatically updated to reflect that change.



#### What is a module?

**Module in Angular** refers to a place where you can group the components, directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application. ==Module gives Angular the information which features does my app have and use==. So Angular **analyzes these NgModules to understand your application and its features**. An Angular application requires at least one such module, the app module. But you may split it into multiple modules.

#### üçìWhat are lifecycle hooks available?

How do you use angular life-cycle hooks in your project?



#### What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

**OK,** first of all `ngOnInit` is part of **Angular lifecycle**, while `constructor` is part of **ES6** JavaScript class, so the major difference starts from right here!...

The `Constructor` is a default method of the class that is executed when the class is instantiated and ensures proper initialization of fields in the class and its subclasses. Angular, or better ==Dependency Injector (DI)==, analyses the constructor parameters and when it creates a new instance by calling `new MyClass()` it tries to find providers that match the types of the constructor parameters, resolves them and passes them to the constructor like new MyClass(someArg);

`ngOnInit` is a life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that Angular is done creating the component.



<img src="/Users/hecate/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210409105349459.png" alt="image-20210409105349459" style="zoom:50%;" />

We use `constructor` to do the `DI(Dependency Injection)` for us 

As you see in the above diagram, `ngOnInit` is happening after the constructor is ready and `ngOnChnages` and get fired after the component is ready for us. All initialisation can happen in this stage, a simple sample is injecting a service and initials it on init.



Angular bootstrap process consists of the two major stages:

- constructing components tree
- running change detection

The constructor of the component is called when Angular constructs components tree. All lifecycle hooks are called as part of running change detection. 

When Angular constructs components tree, the root module injector is already configured so you can inject any global dependencies. Also, when Angular instantiates a child component class, the injector for the parent component is also already set up so you can inject providers defined on the parent component including the parent component itself. ==Component constructors is the only method that is called in the context of the injector== so if you need any dependency that's the only place to get those dependencies.



If you are doing any manipulation of the component's DOM via e.g. **ViewChildren**, **ContentChildren** or **ElementRef**, your native elements will not be available during the constructor phase. However, since `ngOnInit` happens once the component has been created and the checks (`ngOnChanges`) have been called you can access the DOM at this point.

#### How to communicate with components.

There are four ways to communicate between components:

1. Pass Data from URL

   There are two ways to pass the data through URLs in Angular:

   - Router Parameters
   - Query Params

   Router parameters are required parameters. If the parameter is mandatory for the component then we have to use **router parameter**. Otherwise, we can use **query params**. **We have to register the parameter with the URL in the router module**. Pass router param through routerLink directive or pass router param through Router Service. 

2. Pass Data through @Input and @Output

   If we want to pass data from a child to a parent or a parent to a child component we can use @Input and @Output.

3. Pass Data Through a Service Using Observables

   If two components are **siblings or the level of a component in the hierarchy is more distant**, then it‚Äôs good to use a service for passing the data using observables.

4. Ngrx

   It might be the overkill for small applications, although this is an easy way to create data streams across the app. The workflow of making changes to a state is pretty simple. First, you dispatch an action, which is an object with type and payload properties. Then you run a reducer function. The reducer is a simple function, which receives the current state and action, and returns a new state based on action type. Finally, all subscribers get notified by the new state.

#### What is a service?

Service  is a piece of  **reusable code** with a focused purpose. A code that will be used in many  components across application. Components shouldn't fetch or save data directly and they certainly shouldn't knowingly present fake data. They should focus on presenting data and delegate data access to a service. An Angular service is simply a JavaScript function. All we need to do is to  create a class and add methods & properties. We can then **create an  instance of this class in our component and call its methods.** One  of the best uses of services is to get the data from the data source.

#### Explain how to use HttpClient with an example?

**Import HttpClientModule** into root module. We need to import it into our root module `app.module`. Also, we need to add it to the `imports` metadata array.

**Create a service component**, then you should import `HttpClient` the `@angular/common/http` in the component or service. Inject the HttpClient into the service, create functions, call the get, put, post, patch, and delete method to send an http request and return observables that hold the HTTP request data.

**Subscrib**e the observable in the components, which you want to use the data. The request is sent when we `Subscribe` to the observables. When the response arrives map it the desired object and display the result.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
 
@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        HttpClientModule
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

```typescript
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

constructor(public http: HttpClient) {
}


```





#### What are pipes?

**Pipes** are simple functions you can use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. **Pipes** are useful because you can use them throughout your application, while only declaring each **pipe** once.



#### What is the purpose of async pipe?

**Async Pipe** is a **pipe** that automatically subscribes to an observable to emit the latest values. It not only subscribes to an observable, but it also subscribes to a promise and calls the then method. When a new value is emitted, the `async` pipe marks the component to be checked for changes. When the components get destroyed, it automatically unsubscribes them to reduce potential memory leaks.

**Config** 

#### Handle HttpClient Error

If you need to handle errors in only one place, add catch to your request. If you want to add a global solution, use `HttpInterceptor`.



#### üçìWhat are observable creation functions?





#### What is the difference between Behaviorsubject vs Subject?

Using **Behavior Subject** you can **get** the **current value** on Subscription. And whenever if you subscribe using the observable, it will immediately retrieves the current value.

##### Holding Values

If you subscribe to an **subject**, you **won‚Äôt get the current value** or **initial value**. **Subject does not return the current value on Subscription. It triggers only on `.next(value)`call and return/output the `value`**. But when you subscribe to an **Behavior Subject**, you will be able to **get** the **current value** or the **initial value**.

##### Defining Values

You **don‚Äôt** have to **define a default value** whenever you declare the subject. But you **have** to **define a default value** whenever you declare BehaviorSubject based upon the data type.

##### Subscribers 

In Subject, each **next subscribers receive** **only the upcoming values**. üçåIn Behavior Subject, **each next subscribers receive one previous value** and **upcoming values**.

#### What is lazy loading?

Lazy loading is that **we only load the code that belongs to these areas when we really need it**. With lazy loading, we initially only load our root route content, so only the app module code and the code of all the components.

#### What are Route Guards in Angular?

Route Guards are used to Controll Access to or from a Route. For example, the CanDeactivate guard allows you to prevent a user from accidentally leaving a component with unsaved changes. Route guards are most often implemented as classes that implement the needed route guard interface.

Here are the 4 types of routing guards available:

- CanActivate: Controls if a route can be activated.
- CanActivateChild: Controls if children of a route can be activated.
- CanLoad: Controls if a route can even be loaded. This becomes useful for feature modules that are lazy loaded. They won‚Äôt even load if the guard returns false.
- CanDeactivate: Controls if the user can leave a route. Note that this guard doesn‚Äôt prevent the user from closing the browser tab or navigating to a different address. It only prevents actions from within the application itself.

#### What is AOT?

 ==Ahead-of-Time Compilation==. Usually in compile time, Angular will compile javascript code and our templates and then use the logic to update the real DOM. By default, It happens all in our browser. AoT compilation means that process happens during development **as part of the build process**. 

It makes rendering faster. The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first.

#### What is debounce

Debouncing is used to improve browser performance. Sometimes there might be some functionalities in a web page **that we will invoke frequently**. For example, if we type search terms on Google, there will be suggestions about the popular search terms related to what you‚Äôve typed. What happens behind the scene is that with each character we type, the application is triggering API calls constantly to update the popular search term suggestions. This will affect the browser performance. In this kind of situation, we will use the debouncing technique to force the function to wait for a certain amount of time before running again.

#### How to speed-up your Single-Page Application

There are a lot of tools that can help you monitor SPA performance. First, you can use the Chrome Devtools extensions such as [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [Ember Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi?hl=en) or [React Performance Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-performance-devtool/fcombecpigkkfcbfaeikoeegkmkjfbfm?hl=en).

1. **Lazy loading** **feature module**

   Rendering only those parts of the page that are visible to the user at the moment.

   Lazy rendering is useful if your SPA spends a lot of time in the render phase. At this stage, the app creates the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) (the specification of how text, images, and other objects are represented on the page) for all the components on the page.

3. **CDN**

   Using CDNs for Single Page Applications means faster loading of scripts and decreased time-to-interactive. Increased security is a nice bonus.

#### How to speed up first loading of SPAs

**1.Lazy loading** **feature module**

Optimizing the size of the main bundle

Basically, the reason everyone is talking about lazy loading in a performance context is that it is about **making the main bundle as small as possible**. Lazy loading helps with that as we can keep the visible parts, relevant to the initial route, in the main bundle and **lazy load everything else in separate bundles**.

**2.Using optimized images and lazy loading images**

Using lazy laod on images greatly helps in improving page load speed. Lazy loaded images gets loaded only when image comes in user‚Äôs view area. So this reduces extra laoding time at the beginning. You can **put a dummy image of very small size at the place of real image until it gets lazy load.**

**3. AOT**

Angualr cli already provides production flag ‚Äú ‚Äî prod‚Äù to compile ahead of time and **reduce the build size** and its helps greatly so always use production flag to reduce build size.

Another thing you can do is to use **webpack bundle analyzer** to analyse which package causing too much increase in bundle size and replace that package with another package if you can.

**4.  Server side rendering**



 Ionic

memory leak --> navigation between slower and slower

Trackby

#### What‚Äôs Server Side Rendering and do I need it?

Server-side rendering is the most common method for displaying information onto the screen. **It works by converting HTML files in the server into usable information for the browser.** Once the request is done processing, your browser gets back the fully rendered HTML and displays it on the screen. If you then decide to visit a different page on the website, your browser will once again make another request for the new information. This will occur each and every time you visit a page that your browser does not have a cached version of. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the new page only has a few items that are different than the current page, the browser will ask for the entire new page and will re-render everything from the ground up.

On the bright side, server-side rendering is great for SEO. Your content is present before you get it, so search engines are able to index it and crawl it just fine. 

#### Server-side pros:

1. Search engines can crawl the site for better SEO.
2. The initial page load is faster.
3. Great for static sites.

#### Server-side cons:

1. Frequent server requests.

2. An overall slow page rendering.

3. Full page reloads.

4. Non-rich site interactions.

   

#### **How client-side rendering works**

Client-side rendering is rendering content in the browser using JavaScript. So instead of getting all of the content from the HTML document itself, you are getting a bare-bones HTML document with a JavaScript file that will render the rest of the site using the browser.

#### Client-side pros:

1. Rich site interactions
2. Fast website rendering after the initial load.
3. Great for web applications.
4. Robust selection of JavaScript libraries.

#### Client-side cons:

1. Low SEO if not implemented correctly.
2. Initial load might require more time.
3. In most cases, requires an external library.



#### **Did you use Ngrx in your project? What was the purpose?**

Yes, I have used Ngrx in many projects. The purpose of using Ngrx in a Angular application is to have shared states stored in the global store, so that components from different hierarchies can use these states. Ngrx contains store, reducer, action and effects.

#### **What are some disadvantages of Ngrx?**

Ngrx has a deep learning curve for most beginners. It is hard to set up Ngrx. we‚Äôll need to create a store, actions, reducers. (need more)

#### **What is cookie?**

A cookie is just a string that contains some data which is **stored on your browser**. It gets sent to the server **with every http request**. Cookie is also **domain specific**. One website‚Äôs cookies cannot be accessed by other websites. There are usually three main use cases for cookies. First is for user authentication, we use cookies to store the token. Second is to store user preferences such as theme, font, etc. Third is to track user behaviors/path on a website.

#### What is CDN

CDNs offer an easy way to increase the speed of a website while also lowering the latency. 

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by **reducing the physical distance between the server and the user**. This helps users around the world view the same high-quality content without slow loading times.

The goal of the CDN is to **reduce latency** ‚Äì the delay between submitting a request for a web page and the web page fully loading on your device ‚Äì by reducing the physical distance that the request has to travel. For example, a US visitor wishing to view content which originates at a UK-based server will experience poor loading times if this request has to travel across the Atlantic. 

To combat this, CDNs **store a cached version** of your website content in multiple geographical locations around the world, which are known as ‚Äúpoints of presence‚Äù (PoPs). These PoPs will contain their own caching servers and will be responsible for delivering that content in the user‚Äôs location. 

For most CDNs, each request for content will cause the end user to be mapped to an **optimally-located CDN server** and the server will respond with the cached (pre-saved) version of the requested files. If it fails to locate the files, it will look for the content on the other servers in the CDN platform and send the response to the end user. However, when content is unavailable or stale, the CDN will act as a request proxy to the origin server and store the fetched content to serve future requests.

### **WebSockets**

[WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) is a protocol that allows bidirectional communication between the user‚Äôs browser and the server. Unlike with HTTP, the client doesn‚Äôt have to constantly send requests to the server to get new messages. Instead, the browser simply listens to the server and receive the message when it‚Äôs ready.

As the result, you get a connection that in some cases can be [400% faster than the regular HTTP](https://blog.feathersjs.com/http-vs-websockets-a-performance-comparison-da2533f13a77).

#### **If you have many api calls associated with routes requiring authentication, what is your strategy for setting the authorization request header?**

I actually encountered this problem during my last project. The way we solved it was by using interceptors which allowed us to inject the JWT to the authorization request header before each request.

####  What is coercion in JavaScript?

Coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another 

#### What is Scope in JavaScript?

 JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.

**Scope determines these variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.**

#### Null / Undefined in JavaScript

null is a value of a variable. Undefined is when you declared a variable but you didn't assign a value.

#### What is ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù in JavaScript

The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not use undeclared variables.

#### How to do authentication

Yes, we have a login and a signup form. User login with username and password to server. When the user enter their email and password to sign up, the server will generate a **JWT token** and send it back to the client. The token will be stored in the local storage. When the user sends a new HTTP request, we use **interceptor** to inject the token into the header. Once the server receives the token, it will decrypt it to confirm it‚Äôs from an authorized user. That‚Äôs how we do user authentication. In one of my previous projects, the applications also support third-party login, like Google or Facebook login. Those third-party logins also use tokens. For example, for Google login, the server will check your **Google access token** instead of the user name and password. 

#### How to solve the cross-browser issue



#### How to translate English to Chinese for your websit or app, which tool you use, which library you use.

I will use a lib called ngx-translate. Each language is stored in a separate .json file. To switch language you'll first have to add a new JSON file for that language.  We can use translation pipe or we can create a button and a function listened to the click event. In the function, we can all the use function from ngx-translate.



#### How to debug in the browser 

I will use Google Chrome DevTools to debug. I always go to the line that you want to debug when this executes and add a breakpoint in this line.

#### What‚Äôs the difference between var, let, and const.

var is weakest, it will hoisting to function scope automatically.

let is **block-scoped** and reassignable, 

const is unassignable and **block-scoped.**

#### Explain event bubbling and how one may prevent it: 

When an event starts from the deeper child element. Then it works its way up to the outer parent element. Use **event.stopPropagation()** to stop it.

#### How to iterate over object properties and array items? 

for loops. for (**let** key **in** map) { console.log( key, map[key] ) }

#### Rest operator vs spread operator:

 ...spread allows iterable (arrays, objects, strings) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. 

...rest means just in case there are other inputs and put it into an array.

#### What is service in angular? What‚Äôs the benefit of using service in Angular?

Service  is a piece of  **reusable code** with a focused purpose. It will be used in many components across application. I always used service to implement features that are independent of components such a logging services, Share logic or data across components, Encapsulate external interactions like data access. It is very useful to handle  communication between components, especially the sibiling components. We can use dependency injection to use service, like**create an instance of the service in our component and call its methods.**  



#### Dependency Injection, the benefit of dependency injection.

**Dependency Injection** (DI) allows a class receive **dependencies** from another class *without taking care of their instantiation*. In Angular project, we inject dependency in the component constructor function. We can also have services depend on other services throughout the application.

#### Coding question on ‚Äúif there was a setTimeOut and you set it for 0 seconds how does it go/work?‚Äù

**If** you **call setTimeout() with a time of 0 ms**, the function you specify is not invoked right away. Instead, it is placed on a queue to be invoked ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù after any currently pending event handlers finish running.

#### What is currying in js: 

Currying in Javascript is turning a function with multiple parameters into a sequence of functions that have all single parameters. This is good for event handling as well as creating higher-order functions.



####  **What is a promise?**

Promise creates one value, Observable provides multiple values over time. 

Promise is immediately called, it can not stopped, Observable needs subscribed, it can be stopped by unsubscribe.

Promise push errors to its child promises, Observable will handle the error in subscribe method.

Promise only use **.then() .catch() .finally()** clause to manipulate the data step by step. Observable provides a lot of methods to manipulate the data by using **pipe()** and subscription to handle complex applications.



A callback is a function that will **be executed after another function gets executed**. 

Before promises, callbacks were used to handle asynchronous operations. But **using multiple callbacks to handle asynchronous code can lead to unmanageable code.** 

When we are working with promises, we can define these promise independently and when we can aviod many nesting functions by putting many then function in a single line. We can also use **promise.all to call many promise on a line. Promise.race --> one of the promise list is finished.**



#### **How did we do async tasks before promise was introduced?**

We use callback functions. But there is a big disadvantage to it when there are many async steps to a task. It‚Äôs known as callback hell. It makes the code very difficult to read and debug. That‚Äôs why we use promise instead, because we can simply chain the steps by using .then.

#### How to copy an object?

transform the reference. For shallow copy, we can just create a new obj and use the equal sign. If we change a value in the original obj, the value in copied obj will also change.

```
var employeeDetailsDuplicate = employeeDetailsOriginal; //Shallow copy!
```

**Shallow copy is creating a new object that has an exact copy of the values in the original object.** It makes a copy of the reference to X into Y. Think about it as a copy of X‚Äôs Address. So, the addresses of X and Y will be the same i.e. they will be pointing to the same memory location.

For deep copy, we can spread ... to do the first level deep copy. Or we can use  the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` methods. we use

`JSON.stringify()` to change the object to string, and use  `JSON.parse()` to transform the string to obj. But if there is any fnc or dynamic data  in the obj, we can not copy it. In this case we can use method from some third party lib like deepclone from loddash to do the deep copy. It is very reliable but expensive.

```
var employeeDetailsDuplicate = { name: employeeDetailsOriginal.name, age: employeeDetailsOriginal.age, Profession: employeeDetailsOriginal.Profession}; //Deep copy!
```

*// using spread ...* let p1 = {    ...person };

let copiedPerson = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person)); 



**A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields.** It makes a copy of all the members of X, allocates different memory location for Y and then assigns the copied members to Y to achieve deep copy. In this way, if X vanishes Y is still valid in the memory.



#### What is hight order function

Functions that can accept other functions as argument or return a function. 





#### GUI

A **GUI** (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer [software](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/software.htm). A GUI displays objects that convey information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them. 

User interface: The look and feel of **web**-pages and associated apps. Often **developed** by UX (user experience) designers. Applications layer: Underlying programs written in code that sit behind the **UI** and are responsible for the functionality of the graphical user interface.



#### **Are you familiar with design patterns? Can you give me some examples?**

Model-View Controller (MVC)

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

MVVM is a refinement of the MVC design whereby the ViewModel in MVVM facilitates the separation of development of the graphical user interface (UI) - i.e. the Presentation Layer. The ViewModel (VM) is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are more easily managed and presented. In this respect, the ViewModel is more model than view, and handles most if not all of the view's display logic. MVVM is a variation of Martin Fowler's Presentation Model design pattern in that a Presentation Model abstracts the View in a way that is not dependent on the specific UI platform. Hence, neither the Presenter or the View are aware of each other.

#### **Are you familiar with responsive web design? What strategy do you use for it?**

Yes, I am familiar with responsive web design. I like to take the **mobile first approach**. In fact, for most of my projects, my team also have taken the mobile first approach. For example, we would usually get the mobile mockups first from the designers, then we would start developing for mobile screens while the designers work on the desktop mockups.

#### **How do you decide which approach to take? The mobile first or the desktop first?**

It mostly depends on the users and UX. If most users for our application use smaller devices, then it‚Äôs better to take the mobile first approach; whereas if most users use bigger devices, then it‚Äôs better to take the desktop first approach.

#### **How do your UX skills contribute to your UI programming?**

I found that my ability to use the design software helps me a lot when implementing the design. I know how to inspect the details such as font family, margin, padding, and color code on Figma, Adobe XD, or other similar design tools. When the designers forget to export some assets, since I know how to use the design tools, I can export those assets by myself without asking for their help. I even hosted a workshop to let the designers and developers think of how to improve the handoffs, so we can make the collaboration between designers and developers more smooth. The feedback from both the designers and the developers was positive. The designers got better ideas on how to document their idea and what developers are looking for when implementing the design. And the developers also learned how to use the collaboration design platform to inspect the design doc and they can even contribute some feedback on the products.



#### **How to balance the time between design and development?**

Actually. most of the design work is done by our UX designer. I would involved in the design discussion sometime, to help the product team make reasonable decisions so the ideas they bring up are more viable **considering the resources and time constraints we have**. On the other hand, I also facilitate the design handoffs, such as teaching the designers how to better document their idea and teaching the developer how to export assets. It saves both sides a lot of time.
