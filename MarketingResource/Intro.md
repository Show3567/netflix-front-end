### 🍓Intro and project (I will only talk about the high-light part )

==**My name is Siyi. I am a software engineer with 6 years experience. I works across of different industries like the insurance and mainly work on the front-end. During the recent five years, I use Angular4/6/8/11 to do the SPAs**== **I mainly use SASS to do the css. Usually I just develop the reusable CSS from scrach. I also like customize some existing libraries like boostrap and angular material. Also I pretty familiar with the ==Agile development== and I was part of the scrum team in my last project.**



# Travelers

==**My most recent project is from the Travelers insurance Companies.** I finished the project three weeks ago**. I worked on the Risk Management application. The System is an internal system that helps our manager and sales to identify and evaluate risks**.== The system is built by Angular6 at the first time and it is updated to Angular8 after one year. You know there is a big upgrade from Angular 6 to 7. We use many new features like virtual scrolling and the drag and drop in the system. I also customize the drag handles by following the mock up.

==**My responsibilities are developing the dashboard module to display user data and create some form modules to handle user input. I majorly use reactive form instead template-driven form, because reactive form is easy to do the unit testing and it is more flexible to control. I also created a bunch of reusable sub-form to avoid code duplication like address group. And it is easy to change anytime. I used Dynamic form to handle some dynamic data**== like the previous accident cases of customer. ==**Created custom pipe to format input data** ==like phone number and SSN. ==**Used custom validator to do some specific validation**==, for example, to check if the number provided is a valid phone number for the selected country. 

==**The dashboard module can analyze customer information to detect the accident risks. The result will be reported as a set of tables and different types of charts based on different scenario.**== For example, use a line chart, a timeline, to display car collision data of each types of car in each quarter. Product manager and sales can adjust their development direction and selling strategies thought this system. 

 (On the server side, I used Java Spring Boot to develop restful API. For testing, I used Karma and Jasmine to do the unit testing whenever I finish a feature. All my works are version controlled by using git and I am experienced in different workflows, like Scrum and Waterfall. In my daily life, I always follow the mockup, deliver the best product, share my ideas with my team and help to find the best solution for the specific feature.)

When I created the form group,  I separeted the informations into different parts based on their feature and user don't have to finish all of them at a time. It also has a sidenav bar which help user to navigate to other parts of the form. When the user input all the informations, our system will send all the data to Report API and get back a PDF format report.  I majorly use reactive form instead template-driven form in order to provid some customized validatiosn.

==My responsibility is also include optimizing the performance of the front-end application.  And I use **lazy loading** to load the feature module to provide better user experience. Used **NgRx** to manage the global state because the application has a lot of user interactions and multiple data sources.  The same state is used in different components. Instead of injecting services everywhere and managing communication between them, NgRx can manage the application from one singular source.==

I work very closely with the backend team to connect the angular app with the backend API. When I finished a feature or fix a bug, I use Jasmine and Karma to do the unit testing.

The user can also sort, filter and search data by specifying some conditions and for example, using the Datepicker to pick a date period and display the accident case in that period. Here I used angular material to implement a datepicker. 

## 

1. ### why should we hire you

   First, I am a problem solver, During the past few years of experience as a front-end developer,  I became a professial coder  which can understand requirment clearly and solve problem on time with qualified code.

   Second, I am a team player, I used to work at agile developement. collaborate with my teammates.

   and I do love do the communication to make sure that before I start to code I am very clear with requirement. And I used to do mentor section to the junior developer in the team to help the team success.

   

   I will be a good fit for this position.

   

   hard to undersatnd 

   build subject from scratch

   I heard from Anoop that this is an angular position,

    I think I am  fit with this position. I have lots of experience about angular and web development that might contribute some new thoughts when the team needs some new ideas. I also work with different backend technologies such as java spring boot. I can quickly adapt to different team and projects with my past experience.

   Also, I am a team worker. I really enjoy being a part of a team and I am more efficient when I'm able to effectively collaborate with others. In my last position, I was able to communicate with my team to generate some creative solutions and then explain them to peers in marketing and sales that lack technical knowledge.

   

2. ### Why do you choose CVS

   Cvs is one of the biggest companies in US, I used to shop at CVS and it makes me feel very comfortable and convenience. 

   Also, I heard it from  Anoop who is the interviewer yestaday that team is planning to upgrade your application from angular9 to angular11 which is the one that I am learning recently. It is using webpack5 which provide module federation features to help us easy scale our app into micro front-end architecture. I am really looking forward to dive into it if I have a chance. I always want to work with awesome people like you guys to make the team success.

   

   I am also learning the micro-front-end and module federation right now. Module federation is a new technology in Angular 11.  It lets you combine separate builds to form a single application and release the front-end architecture. So we can use multiple front-end framework like react and angular in a single application.

   

   (It allows JavaScript application to dynamically import code from another application at runtime)

   

3. ### What is your short term goal

   If I get the position, first I would like to be fully responsible for my job and be an expert in the area. Collaborating with my teammate and helping the team to build something really awesome and do the mentoring for the junior developer if needed. Learning some new techniques and keep updating myself.

   

4. ### What is your long term goal

   For long term goal, I want to understand more about the business logic of the company. As a front-end developer, I works across different industry. But I mainly focus on the technique part and barely care about the business logic behind the application. In the future, I want to pay more attention on the customer service and web design. I want to be a web architect in the future.

   

5. ### conflict

   #### with manager

   For my last project, first we are using behaviorSubject to manage the state. When the application became bigger and bigger, it is really hard to track the data flow.  The data flow can be a mess. From the perspective of developers, I thought it was time to update our application and use NGRX to manage the state. So we would have only one data flow in our application. It would became more secure and easier to manage. But our team leader disagree with me. Because we were very closed to Q2 release, and from his perspective, there was no business value to upgrade the application now. We had a session to share our thought together, came up with pros and cons. We follow the agree with disagree rule, not about who is right or wrong. It is very common. At the end, we got an agreement. We would spend two sprint to refactor the code using NGRX after Q2 release.

   

   **Weakness**

   It is one of my weakness. Sometimes, I only care about the development part and do not have enough understanding about business logic.

   

   Quarter realease

   on call ---> fix bug

   

   #### with UI designer

   As a UI developer, I had a conflict with UX designer. There was a popup that has autofocus on the Yes button. The popup was about deleting a row of transaction data in a table. For my developer standpoint, I think it is dangerous to have autofocus on Yes when dealing with deletion on important information. I then discussed this issue with my UX designer. He thought the autofocus should be put on Yes normally. It would provide better user experience.  We grouped a meeting to discuss about the pros and cons. By the end, we cancel the autofocus for security reason. It is nothing personal. We just look at things in a different perspective.  Taking perspective of others really helps me collabrate with my co-worker.

6. ### Do you familiar with agile development

   #### Have you did any peer review

   - **We use scrum and our sprint size is two weeks.**

   - **We have sprint planning meeting at the beginning of every sprint. The PO will put all the tickets into the jira backlog. Our team will go through them, seperate the user story into small task, discuss the priority and estimate the story points based the time we need to work on that,** we will also have a picture of what are the potential shippable products when the sprint ends. We have a team leader. He will take charge of the whole unit and **assign these tickets** to other UI developers. Senior developers will take up to 15 points.

     1pt – 1day | 3pt – 3 day | 5pt  –week| 8pt  – more than one week

   - Basically we have the **standup meeting every day, report what we completed since the last meeting, what we are working on, anything that maybe blocked or need help.**

   - By the end of each sprint, we will have a **demo meeting with PO** to show what we have down in this sprint and **a retrospective meeting to discuss what we can impove in the future.** 

   - Then it just cycle, go over again and agian until we release our final version of product

   

   Sometimes if the business logic or requirement is no clear, we will talk to PO directly.

   For example, in my last project, we need to implement a data filter. The filter logic  is very complex and the data size is also very large. I was not clear if we need to filter the data in the whole database or just filter the data in the single page. So I had a quick talk with our PO to get a clear view about the business logic and implement it based on his requirement.

   

7. ### How could you update yourself

   My company provides a monthly **mentor session** , each developer provides new things or new technology to each other. Also, I will always update myself when I want to solve some problem. Do some research first, figure out what is the trendy solution for a problem. Then I will dive into it, watch tutorial videos, read documentation, and build demo with it. 

8. ### Have you ever blocked by you co-woker

   When I was blocked by my co-worker. 

   First, I will leave a comment on jira, point out the block to our team. Let the team leader and my co-woker know the situation.

   Then I will try to find a solution by myself. 

   I remembered once I finished my feature and I was not able to finish it because of the back-end is not ready. Our back-end developers were pretty busy at that time and they were doing their best. I did not want to put too many pressure on them. What I did is getting the data structure from backend developers and fake some demo data by using fake.js. I used  **JSON server** to create a demo server to see if my UI can fetch and post data correctly. And at the end of the sprint, the backend was still not finished, so we decided to just present the UI with demo data. 

   If I really can not find a solution, I will informed my manager about the situation and to see if we can re-estimate the time.

9. ### Do you have any backend experience

   I worked 80% on front-end and 20% on back-end. 

   In my last project, I was hired as angular developer, so I mainlly focus on front-end. I worked very closely with back-end team to discuss about the api structure, what technique we can use to optimizing the perfomance and so on. 

   I also work very closely with our UI to talk about the data structure and make sure I fully understand the mock up.

   I always want to dive deep into backend and become a full stack developer some day. 

10. ### Have you ever used docker before

    I know Docker is a Container technology even though I did not directly build any image. But our team used Travis CI to do the CI/CD pipeline. I used to work on the CI/CD config yaml file to setup the UI test and linting script. If there is any chance, I do want to dive into it because it

    

    Travis CI builds can run and build Docker images, and can also push images to Docker repositories or other remote storage.

    To use Docker add the settings to your `.travis.yml`.

    Travis CI is that **it runs your program's tests every time you commit to GitHub** (this can be configured in many ways, and you can always disable builds on some branches). **The point of this is that you can often discover very quickly if your commit broke something, and fix it before it becomes a problem**. I would recommend running Travis CI on every GitHub repo that you have unit tests in and is using a programming language supported by Travis CI.

    

11. ### Accessibility 

    Our company do has the ADA team to test the accessibility of our applications. I was assigned to fix some bugs about the Accessibility. 

    You know, **screenreaders** must read out all the navigation links before getting to the main site content. And in the application, we have almost 7 navigation links and 40 sub-links at the top of the home page. A sighted user can jump visually past these links and begin reading the main content of the page. 

    But it would take **one minute for screen reader** to read out all the links. In order to improve the user experience for disable users, I added a **Skip navigation links provided before menu items**. It  allowed users to skip the navigation and go directly to an anchor point, usually at where the main content begins. 

    

12. ### internationalization and localization

    l10n: **Localization** is the process of **building versions of your app** for different locales, including extracting text for translation into different languages, and formatting data for particular locales. A locale identifies a region (such as a country) in which people speak a particular language or language variant.

    i18n: **Internationalization** is the design and development of a product, application or document content that ***enables*** easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.

    g11n: **Globalization** is the interaction of people, governments, and companies on a global scale. In business terms, globalization is the process of taking a business global to expand markets beyond national borders. This includes conducting research, developing strategies, planning, internationalization, localization, and translation of products, services, and/or content, as well as quality assessment.

    

13. ### testing

    I used Jasmine and Karma to do the unit testing when I fixed a bug or finished a new feature.

    For end-2-end test, our QA team take charge of it by using Cypress. Since cypress is using Javascript, I help our QA setting the environment. It is very interesting for me.

    I am willing to diving deep into it anytime.

14. ### How do you deal with deadline/can not fit the requirement

    I always post a comment into jira if I meet any problems. Let my team leader and co-worker knows the situation I am facing right now. If I really can not finish it on time, I will communicate with my team leader to explain the reason and re-estimate the time. 

    

    If I have no clue about a ticket, I will do some research first.

    If I can not find a solution by myself, I usually ask expert for guildance. 

    

15. ### academic

    I got my master degree on Dec 2020. I worked full-time with CPT and took some cources at the same time.

16. ### Peer review

    You know, when we finish our ticket, our work should be reviewed by our co-workers. It happened when I was reviewing other's work. His task is creating a large table list to hold the order transaction data on mobile devices. He used **infinite scroll** to handle the table. As new content loads in the table, it will keep adding to your DOM and increasing the memory requirement. In my opinions, I think if the dataset is scalling up in the future or if we want to add some options on each row of data, it will cause some lags. So I suggested him to use **virtual scroll** instead of infinite scroll. Only those items which are visible to the user at any time are rendered. Other items which are not visible are removed from the DOM. He disagreed with me. He was not familiar with  **virtual scroll** and he thought there was no need to use a new technique when **infinite scroll** was good enough for now. However, in our next sprint, our UX want to add a dropdown menu to each row of data, it allowed our user to edit, delete, save it or navigate to the detail page. He still used **infinite scroll** and add a menu to each row. Our QA reported that when the data was more than 5000 rows, there is an UI degradation for the menu opening. He finally agreed with me and changed to use virtual scroll.





### Why are you passionate about front-end development?

**It is one of the ways I can impact lives outside my circle of influence. **I love building good user experience. Every image optimization or padding increase or CSS animation makes a big difference to every single user. **It challenges me to improve.* 

# Customize Questions(stroies)

## MathWorks

I worked at **MathWorks** company for one and half year.The project I involved in is the **Simulink Report Generator**. It enable you to include block diagrams, State flow charts, MATLAB Function blocks and other model elements in your reports. It allows our user to generate Reports In several simple steps. It can generate reports in PDF format. 

The module I built is more like a **multi-step form module.** In here, User can select the model or diagrams they want to include in their report, setup the parameters. They can also layout or style the report as they want. I broke a very long form down into several steps. Each step contains a set of **controls** and can have their own **layout**. It basically leads user to complete the information in smaller chunks, which creates a positive user experience.

Since our Report Generator can generate many types of report, the input form can **change frequently based on user input**. I use **dynamic form** to generate the forms. So It can make real-time changes to the forms based on user input. 

I work very closely with the backend team to connect the angular app with the backend reporter API. When I finished a feature or fix a bug, I use Jasmine and Karma to do the unit testing.

## China Investment Corporation

My first project is from **China Investment Corporation**. I worked on the Data Transaction Report. It is to **record**, **categorize**, **analyze** and **updated** financial dates for **every transaction** of the compony. Because we have thousands of transaction within a day, the Data Transaction Report helps investment analyst manage daily transactions more easily. 

They can **sort** and **filter** the transaction by share, price, amount, transaction time and so on. The transaction data can also be displayed as **timeline** or **pie chart** if the user setup the parameters, we use exsting chart library the **D3** to implement it and customize a little bit based on the design. 

The transaction data is changing very fast. In order to get real-time data, I used **server side event**. It provides automatic updates from a server.

## Biggest Challenge

==Virtual scrolling== (share my idea with design team && challenge)

Previously I was assigned to create a large table list on mobile devices (to hold the order transaction data - ticket ) . Each list item has a menu where user can click and show some detail data and options.  First I use **infinite scroll** to handle the scrolling. Then I got feedback from our QA. It said when the list size was more than 5000,  the menu is opening very slowly. I hard coded some data and kept an eye on the **memory tab** in **Chrome Developer Tools** and also **observed the UI** for any lags. You know, as new content loads in the list, it will keep adding to your DOM and increasing the memory requirement. So I do some reseach and read some docs online.  I found a new feature, the **Virtual scrolling**, which is added to Angular7. Only those items which are visible to the user at any time are rendered. Other items which are not visible are removed from the DOM. the scrolling is also very smooth and the memory requirement is very low.

==Customize ngx-chart==

One of my task was to build dynamic bar Chart with user interaction, when you click on one of the bar, it shows a detail popup with some detail informations like insurrance sales, accident rate.  In the popup form, we can also populate some calculation and display another optimization report on the side. The **challenge** was to customize the already existing chart library, the ngx-chart, with user interaction and position the popup based on the user mouse position clicked. It's a only 3 day-urgent ticket. So, I read documentation and did a lot of CSS customization using SASS to calculate the x and y coordinates relative to the browser window. I also used event binding to control the interaction and fulfill the requirements.

![image-20210510114317720](/Users/hecate/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20210510114317720.png)

==Dynamic content and last row of cards spacing==

The most recent bug was on the insurance data display page. It display each insurances as a card with title, content, link and picture, aligned horizontally. When the QA team do the UI testing, they reported me that there were some weird display with the last row, So I hard coded some data to check that and found the previous developer used flex display and set justfy-content as space-between. And since our data is dynamic, we can not have the content planned out in advance. To fix the bug, I use the pseudo element `after` from SASS to autofills the space.

.card::after {
    content: "";
    flex: auto;
  }

==Building real-time charts==

Building dynamic charts to present data which is changing very fast, we started using **polling system (make interval by using JS to keep triggering Api call)**. Since we have a lot of end users, they’re constantly fetching API calls every 5 seconds. The performance isn’t good and we were making unnecessary request all the time. I got feedback from backend developers that maybe this isnt most optimal way to do it. To get real time data, we have several options such as web socket and server side event (server side event). We chose server side event because it provides automatic updates from a server. It limits the number of connections for data on the client to one.

**Bidirectional** --> server and clients

A [W*ebSocket* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)is a persistent connection between the client and the server. This is a communications protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

SSE is a mechanism that allows the server to asynchronously push the data to the client once the client-server connection is established. The server can then decide to send data **whenever a new “chunk” of data is available**. It can be considered as a one-way *publish-subscribe* model.



### **The recent bug you fixed**

==debounce==

I was assigned a ticket to fix a bug. There is chart generator in our applications. If users enter some parameters, it will trigger an API call, fetch data and a chart will be rendered at the underneath section. The bug is that when users click submit multiple times with different search keys. While the data fetching is still ongoing, t**he final displayed content will be for the previous version**, not the current one, which causes a bad user experience. 

From my experience, this might be something related to **race conditions.** When I started to work on fixing the bug, I located the components where we handle the API call. I wrote a unit-test using Jasmine. Finally, I decided to use ***switchMap*** and set ***debounceTime*** to make sure we don’t send too many API calls in few seconds and that we get only the results from the latest request. 

## Team size

Our team has 10 person

1 product owner

1 team leader (he is also a full satck developer)

2 back-end developer

2 UX designer

2 QA 

## Workflow

- **We use scrum and our sprint size is two weeks.**

- **We have sprint planning meeting at the beginning of every sprint. The PO will put all the tickets into the jira. Our team will go through them and discuss the priority, estimate the story points based the time we need to work on that,** we will also have a picture of what are the potential shippable products when the sprint ends. We have a senior UI developer. He will take charge of the whole unit and **assign these tickets** to other UI developers. Senior developers will take up to 15 points.

  1pt – 1hr | 3pt – 1 day | 5pt  – few days | 8pt  – week | 13pt - challenge – 2week 

- Basically we have the **standup meeting every day, report what we completed since the last meeting, what we are working on, anything that maybe blocked or need help.**

- By the end of each sprint, we will have a **demo meeting with PO** to show what we have down in this sprint and **a retrospective meeting to discuss what we can impove in the future.** 

- Then it just cycle, go over again and agian until we release our final version of product



- When I get my tickets, I may have a short meeting with UX or back-end developers to discuss what they actually need.
- We use git to do version control and use github to push the code. I will create my own feature branch based on the ticket I got and name it based on the feature I am going to implement.
- When I finish my ticket, I will use **Jasmine** and **Karma** to write unit testing. 
- When it passed all the test, I will push my local branch. The CI/CD will listen to every changes and automatically run testing, linting and building to our code.
- When all the CI/CD test passed, we need to do the **peer review**. After that, I can merge my feature branch to dev branch. CI/CD will run again to deplay our codes to the dev server, then our QA will work on that.
- QA will test it and put feedback into JIRA. If they find any bug, they will create a JIRA ticket to report a bug. If the code is error free, we will merge the dev branch into our master branch. CI/CD will automatically deploy our codebase to the production serve.

### **The recent features you worked on**

Recently I’ve done a feature of creating the **Virtual scroll** for mobile devices. The table list can be rather long sometimes. For large-screen devices, we show the table list in **pagination**, but pagination is cumbersome for mobile device users. Therefore we decided to add an **Virtual scroll** feature for mobile devices. I was assigned the task of implementing the feature. I took some time to study about realizing **Virtual scroll** using Angular. I found a model called ScollingModule from Angular CDK that can solve this problem in a neat way. The library help creates a window that contains limited rows and keeps updating the data inside the rows when users scroll the page. Only those rows which are visible to the user at any time are rendered. Other items which are not visible are removed from the DOM. Through this way, it can render a large list efficiently, the scrolling is also very smooth and the memory requirement is very low. Some testing data is very long and have more than ten column, so I only show the test date, sensor ID, test name in the table. Other information will show as a popup form when user click the row. I played around with it and was amazed by the user experience it provided. UI degradation will not happen even we are displaying 5000 rows of data. 

## How would you deal with a conflict between you and your colleagues?

==Virtual scolling== with teammates



==auto focus== with UX

I had a conflict with UX designer. There was a popup that has autofocus on the Yes button. The popup was about deleting a row of transaction data in a table. For my developer standpoint, I think it is dangerous to have autofocus on Yes when dealing with deletion on important information. I then discussed this issue with my UX designer. He thought the autofocus should be put on Yes normally.  We had a session to share our thought together, came up with pros and cons. We follow the agree with disagree rule, not about who is right or wrong. By the end, we cancel the autofocus for security reason.



**Ngrx** with other team member

### **Why should we hire you**

I see myself as a self-driven person, a self-learner, whenever I see something I don’t understand, I will read documentation, undstanding it and do some demos for new technologies. Also, I have lots of experience about angular and web development that might contribute some new thoughts when the team needs some new ideas. I also work with different backend technologies such as java spring and Node with Express. I can quickly adopt to different team and projects with my past experience.

## How can you test your feature if the backend is not finished?/ What can you do when your work are blocked by your co-worker?

When I am working on something that needs to be implemented only after something that has to be done by my co-worker. First, I will try to find a solution. I remembered once I finished my feature and I was not able to test it because of the back-end delay. Our back-end developers were pretty busy at that time and they were doing their best. I did not want to put too many pressure on them. What I did is getting the data structure from backend developers and hard coding some demo data by myself. I used  **JSON server** to create a demo webservice to see if my UI can fetch and post data properly. And at the end of the sprint, the backend was still not finished, so I just present the UI with demo data. 

If I really can not find a solution, I will informed my manager about the situation and to see if we can re-estimate the time.

## How do you keep updating yourself?

My company provides a monthly **mentor session** , each developer provides new things or new technology to each other. Also, I will always update myself when I want to solve some problem. Do some research first, figure out what is the trendy solution for a problem. Then I will dive into it, watch tutorial videos, read documentation, and build demo with it. 

## Accessibility

**Alt**

I remembered once our PO assigned a ticket to make our application to be accessible for disable users. Our QA team tested accessibility by using WAVE(web accessibility testing tool). They reported a ticket. It said screen reader just ignore all the image on our application. So I took a look at the templates and figured out that our previous UI developers did not add **alternative text** to images. The alt attribute did not affect the view or functionality of our application. So all our developers just overlooked it. I added some simple alt text based on what the image is about and shared this problem with our team in the retrospective meeting. We all agreed to always add a alt text whenever we use an image, just in case we may add accessibility later.

**Too Many Navigation Links**

I previously got a ticket from our QA team. You know, screenreaders must read out all the navigation links before getting to the main site content. And in the application, we have almost 50 navigation links at the top of the home page. A sighted user can jump visually past these links and begin reading the main content of the page. But it would take one minute for screen reader to read out all the links. In order to improve the user experience for disable users, I added a Skip navigation links provided before menu items. It  allowed users to skip the navigation and go directly to an anchor point, usually at where the main content begins.

### 🍓Cross browser problem

Our QA team have performed some cross-browser testing by using **browserstack** and **LambdaTest** to make sure the website is compatible with all target devices. I remembered once we used local storage to to keep the username saved. So when a user comes back, it can autofill the username and any other user preferences data. If the user is in incognito or private mode, local Storage data will not be available.(==Don't know how to fix it==)

**Incognito mode** stops **Chrome** from saving your **browsing** activity to your local history. Your activity, like your location, might still be visible to: Websites you visit, including the ads and resources used **on** those sites.

With [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/), you can test over 2000+ browsers, and OS combinations hosted by Virtual Machines running through their cloud servers. 



**Input/ type = "date" is not supported by any Internet Explorer version, neither by Safari nor by Opera mini. **

We can use Datapicker from angular material to fix the problem.

## How to translate English to Chinese for your websit or app, which tool you use, which library you use.

I will use a lib called **ngx-translate**. Each language is stored in a separate .json file. To switch language you'll first have to add a new JSON file for that language.  We can use translation pipe or we can create a button and a function listened to the click event. In the function, we can all the use function from ngx-translate.

### Module Federation(new feature from webpack 5, used by angular 11)

The Module Federation integrated in Webpack beginning with version 5 allows the loading of separately compiled program parts. Hence, it finally provides an official solution for the implementation of microfrontends.

In short, Module Federation allows JavaScript application to **dynamically import code from another application at runtime.** The module will build a unique JavaScript entry file which can be downloaded by other applications by setting up the Webpack configuration to do so.

### What is your two greatest strength?

First, I have a strong passion about my life and my work. I really like what I am doing right now. **It is one of the ways I can impact lives outside my circle of influence. **I love building good user experience. Every image optimization or padding increase or CSS animation makes a big difference to every single user. **It challenges me to improve.* 

Secondly, I see myself as a self-driven person, a self-learner, whenever I see something I don’t understand, I will read documentation, undstanding it and do some demos for new technologies. 

### Hobbies

When I am in my personal time, I would like to go hiking with my friends, go jogging a little bit to release the pressure, Sometimes I also take Yoga class or boxing class to stay health and active. I also enjoy trying new restaurant, cooking by following some youtuber, meeting awsome people and leaning new things everyday.

### What I want to learn in the future?

I am leaning [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) recently. It allows **bidirectional communication** between the user’s browser and the server. Unlike with HTTP, the client doesn’t have to constantly send requests to the server to get new messages. Instead, the browser simply listens to the server and receive the message when it’s ready. I think the technique is very cool. But I did not get a chance to dive deep into it and use it in real-project.
